# SHARC trajectory cut-off-er
# This script goes into a SHARC directory, and then finds the first time where
# the energy gap between the current state and a defined 'ground' state is less
# than a set threshold. After that, it alters the output.xyz and output.dat
# 
# use command 
# for i in `ls -d */`; do cd $i ; ./thisscript.py ; $SHARC/data_extractor.x newoutput.dat ; cd .. ; done 
#
# this requires that you've already run $SHARC/data_extractor.x - if you haven't, do, or uncomment the first os.system command
# this will print the changed output to files called newoutput.dat and newoutput.xyz - imaginatively corresponding to output.dat and output.xyz respectively
#
# according to the source code of SHARC (from mar 21), the output.dat file is the only file that is needed to generate the data - the .lis and .log files are purely for humans
