# The problem of finding the angle between a plane and a vector is the same as finding the angle between two vectors, one normal to the plane and the vector that we can to analyse
# This script does this.
# The notation is thus  - central point is the point common to both the vector the plane (if there is more than one point which does this, your vector is a sub-space of the plane or you are very non-euclidean)
#                       - vector point is the other point of the vector (i.e. the non planar atom)
#                       - plane points are the two opther atoms which define the plane
#
# Use
# $ split -d  --a4 -l(no_of_atoms) output.xyz
# $ for i in `ls x????`: do ./plane_angle_finder.py $i >> output.out ; done
